# Changelog

## ws09 — 2026-08-30 — logs that parse

`log_format`, `access_log` and `error_log` carry: the escape rules
probed byte-for-byte against the oracle, and the access-log
differential (identical directives, identical adversarial requests on
both servers) reads 4/4 identical modulo timestamps. `format=json` is
the typed door — RFC 8259-validated lines, numbers as numbers, the
ws08 drain vocabulary decoded. Sinks are bounded and loud-dropping in
the spawn-free loop; logrotate's reopen cycle works end to end. Three
new lints (L005 inert level, L006 native doors, L007 what a text
format loses). Corpus 166 → 184.

## ws06 — 2026-08-30 — certificates without the dance

Built-in ACME: RFC 8555 HTTP-01 end to end, hot-swap issuance with no
reload, a renewal daemon, and `lobo cert status`. The certbot dance
still works — the coexistence test serves a certbot block live beside
a `cert auto` block. The fixture CA is a pebble-class RFC 8555 server
written in wolf, verifying account JWS on every POST with real
dial-backs; it caught two client bugs a vendored oracle would have
accepted. Deltas recorded: Ed25519 not ES256 (the frozen jose seam),
loopback-plain `cert_ca` only until a std TLS client exists (D25),
key files at umask not 0600 (D26). Corpus 158 → 166.

## wsm03 — 2026-08-29 — the name lands

Lobo (D64) — the code stops spelling wws: 86 files, the binary's own
voice (banner, diagnostics, `Server: lobo/0.1.0`, LOBO-L lint codes),
zero seam motion. Pins advance to wolf addcd7f + the lupin 0.1.16
tag, and the first macOS three-lane gauntlet runs 158/158 — two
rig-side deltas fixed on the way (the TLS oracle refuses LibreSSL by
name; the signal gate widens so a real SIGHUP drives the drain
off-linux). wolf-lang#146 re-probed unhealed; the midend stays off.

## wsm02 — 2026-08-27 — the pin pays back

Pins to wolf 53f6191 + lupin is24, zero source breakage. TLS session
keys now come from `os_random` — the OS CSPRNG, trapping loud rather
than degrading (#143 retires) — with the interim HKDF derivation
deleted and an entropy probe at TLS bind. The three W0305 sentinel
dodges revert to the natural arm re-raise (is24's #44 fix). The
midend flip-back was attempted and refused: a #142-class survivor
found, filed as wolf-lang#146, `WOLF_MIDEND=0` stays.

## ws07 — 2026-08-27 — the dry-run that means something

`-t --request` predicts the routing decision with a why-it-lost
trace: the real matcher grows a trace parameter (never a second
implementation), effective directives filter to the winning chain
with `-T` provenance, TLS and stat notes are opt-in, and unknowable
headers say UNRESOLVED by name rather than guessing. Cross-checked
against the live server: the predicted static path's bytes are the
live body, and the backend records exactly the predicted proxy
target. Text stanzas or schema-1 JSON.

## ws05 — 2026-08-27 — TLS integrates

`listen … ssl` serves HTTPS over wolf's own TLS 1.3 stack (the
wolf-std handshake, record layer and certificate rungs), OpenSSL
interop 8/8, SNI selection, and the certbot renewal-reload cycle
carries.

## wsm01 — 2026-08-27 — the pin catches up

Pins to wolf 64a38f3 + lupin b682bcf: a real SIGHUP drives the drain
(the signal surface landed upstream), and binary files serve over
byte paths.

## ws08 — 2026-08-27 — the drain you can watch

Reload's connection draining becomes observable: per-generation live
counters on the status surface, the drain witnessed in tests, and the
serve loop reshaped into the multiplexer poll loop the later sprints
build on.

## ws04 — 2026-08-27 — the shell

CLI and exit-code parity with nginx (`-t`, `-T`, `-s`, the signal
set), and control-channel reload with connection draining. The
serving campaign (wsc01) closes.

## ws03 — 2026-08-27 — it proxies

Upstream pools, `proxy_pass`, hop-by-hop header discipline; the
two-sided differential runs 7/7 byte-equal to nginx.

## ws02 — 2026-08-26 — it serves

HTTP/1.1 static serving over an RFC 9112 MUST-checklist parser, the
historical-CVE corpus v0 held to refuse-or-trap-clean, byte-equal to
nginx on the differential. W1 declared.

## ws01 — 2026-08-26 — the config carries

The nginx config surface: 76 oracle probes, 87 directive table rows,
three lints firing at load, and `-T` that knows which file set every
directive. The scaffolding campaign (wsc00) closes.

## ws00 — 2026-08-26 — the repo and the harness

Pins (wolf 87405ac / lupin e2dbd40, the `.wolf-bin` ritual), the
loopback HTTP rig written in wolf, the pinned-nginx differential with
its first byte-equal case, the gauntlet, and CI against the pins —
committed ahead of any remote.
